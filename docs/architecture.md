# Jware Trader V4 Architecture

## Overview

Jware Trader V4 is built using a microservices architecture that provides scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. The system is designed to handle real-time trading operations with high reliability and performance.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Web UI (Next.js)**
   - Modern React-based frontend
   - Server-side rendering for performance
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

2. **API Gateway (Express/Node.js)**
   - Central entry point for all API requests
   - Request routing and load balancing
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and security
   - WebSocket proxy for real-time data

3. **Trading Engine (FastAPI/Python)**
   - Core trading logic and strategy execution
   - Order management system
   - Position tracking and P&L calculation
   - Risk management and validation
   - Integration with broker APIs

4. **Market Data Service (FastAPI/Python)**
   - Real-time price feeds
   - Historical data management
   - Technical indicator calculations
   - Data normalization and caching
   - WebSocket streaming

5. **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**
   - Primary data storage
   - Time-series optimization for market data
   - ACID compliance for trading operations
   - Automatic data partitioning

6. **Redis**
   - High-performance caching
   - Pub/Sub for real-time updates
   - Session storage
   - Rate limiting backend

## Data Flow

### Order Execution Flow

```
User → Web UI → API Gateway → Trading Engine → Broker API
                     ↓              ↓
                   Redis      PostgreSQL
```

1. User submits order through Web UI
2. Request passes through API Gateway for authentication
3. Trading Engine validates order against risk rules
4. Order sent to broker API
5. Execution status stored in PostgreSQL
6. Real-time updates sent via Redis pub/sub

### Market Data Flow

```
Market Data Provider → Market Data Service → Redis → WebSocket → Web UI
                              ↓
                         PostgreSQL
```

1. Market data received from external providers
2. Data normalized and validated
3. Stored in TimescaleDB for historical analysis
4. Published to Redis for real-time distribution
5. Streamed to connected clients via WebSocket

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions
- **API Key Management**: For programmatic access
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed sessions

### Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based configuration
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation

### Network Security

- **API Gateway**: Single entry point
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **CORS Policy**: Controlled cross-origin access
- **Firewall Rules**: Network-level protection

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Services**: All services designed for horizontal scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Database Replication**: Read replicas for query scaling
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis cluster for distributed caching

### Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O throughout
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries and materialized views

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging

- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for easy parsing
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across services
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log management
- **Log Levels**: Configurable verbosity

### Metrics

- **Service Health**: Health check endpoints
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput
- **Business Metrics**: Trade volume, success rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk usage

### Alerting

- **Health Checks**: Automated service monitoring
- **Error Rates**: Alert on anomalies
- **Performance Degradation**: Latency alerts
- **Business Alerts**: Risk limit breaches

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Run tests
docker-compose exec [service-name] pytest
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Code Commit**: Push to feature branch
2. **Automated Tests**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Code Review**: Peer review process
4. **Build**: Docker image creation
5. **Deploy**: Staged rollout to production

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Python 3.11**: Trading Engine, Market Data Service
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async API framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM with async support
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue (future)

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with SSR
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching

### Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Local development
- **Kubernetes**: Production orchestration (future)
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and load balancer

### Databases

- **PostgreSQL 15**: Primary database
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series extension
- **Redis 7**: Caching and pub/sub

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Strategy optimization
2. **Multi-Broker Support**: Additional integrations
3. **Mobile Applications**: iOS/Android apps
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Performance attribution
5. **Social Trading**: Copy trading features

## Conclusion

The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. Each component has a clear responsibility and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This approach allows for rapid iteration while maintaining system stability.
